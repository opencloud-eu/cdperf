# Description

The `share upload rename` test mimics a typical end user resource sharing scenario.

The admin user shares a parent folder with each of his colleagues, who in turn create a folder
in the received share per iteration and user then uploads a fixed number of files.
To finish, the folder in which the files are located is renamed by each user.


## Procedure

* `admin` creates `N` users.
  * `N` can be set with the `--vus` option.
  * by default, it set to 1.
* `admin` creates a folder `oc-share-upload-rename`.
* `admin` shares that folder to each of the users.
* each `user` logs into the system individually.
* each `user` creates a folder `$ITERATION-initial-$USERNAME` inside the received share.
* each `user` uploads `10` files with a size of `1mb` each into this folder.
* each `user` renames the folder `$ITERATION-initial-$USERNAME` to `$ITERATION-final-$USERNAME`.
* `admin` deletes the `oc-share-upload-rename` folder.
* `admin` deletes the created users.

the test runs `N` times for each user, for example if you define `--vus 2` and `--iterations 5`
the testing steps as a whole will run 10 times (5 times per user).
